# Project2: zahraa yarnn

## Introduction

As part of my General Assembly course, I was tasked with building a full-stack web application using the MEN stack (MongoDB, Express, and Node.js). For this project, I decided to create a website inspired by my small business, which focuses on handmade crochet crafts.

The goal of the project was not only to showcase my technical skills in back-end and front-end development but also to reflect something Iâ€™m personally passionate about. The website allows users to browse different crochet products, learn more about the craft, and engage with the brand in an interactive way. By combining clean design with functional features such as product listings, user interactions, and database integration, I aimed to create a platform that feels both professional and authentic to my business.
